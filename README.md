# Task 2 : Recommendation System:
Description:
The provided Python code implements a basic movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The system utilizes a sample dataset of user ratings for movies. It calculates the cosine similarity between users based on their movie preferences and predicts unrated movies for a given user by considering the ratings of similar users. The code includes functions to compute user similarity, provide movie recommendations, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation. The recommendation system demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to suggesting movies to users based on the preferences of others with similar tastes.

# Task 3 TIC-TAC-TOE AI
The provided Python code represents a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple AI opponent. The game is implemented using a `TicTacToe` class, which keeps track of the game board, checks for a winner, determines if the board is full, and handles player moves. The AI opponent utilizes the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves. The `play` function orchestrates the gameplay, allowing the user to input moves and playing against the AI until the game concludes with a win, tie, or loss. The code aims to provide an interactive and challenging Tic-Tac-Toe experience for the user.
